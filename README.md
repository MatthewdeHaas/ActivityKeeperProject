## Running App

### Description:
- **Data**: Utilises the Strava API in displaying various forms of your data in graph format
- **Utilities**: Provides a pace/dist/time conversion calculator and a smart pace calculator based on a 5k personal best
- **Scheduler**: Provides a tool for scheduling milegae throughout the week

### Current Timeline:

- Implement/discard any lingering ui additions to the site:
    - [ ] Set goal/goal progress donut graph (doable but will require some data in script.js; ok to leave for later as it won't make the site feel unfinished)
    - [ ] Customisable graph (data type, sport, number of weeks back, etc.)
    - [ ] Title and tab logo icon
    - [ ] Header on the scheduler
    - [x] Remove the current file index.html and rename home.html to index.html
    - [ ] Delete styles.css when everything once everything is using tailwind
- Spend time making the UI look more finished/not so thrown together (Tailwind):
    - [x] Home
    - [ ] Find Pace
    - [ ] Pace Calculator
    - [ ] Scheduler
